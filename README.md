# Wave-function-collapse algorithm with Unity
This Unity example project utilizes the wave-function-collapse algorithm to procedurally generate levels on a two-dimensional grid.

## About this project
Using Unity version `2019.1.14f1`.

### [Try it out here!](https://www.atalantus.de/projects/games/wfc/index.html)


### The Algorithm

**Note:**
This implementation of the WFC-algorithm is not complete and it might resolve adjacent modules which edge types aren't actually fitting when the given module set is not complete! (Note that the module set in this project is complete)
Im still experimenting with this algorithm and currently developing a free Unity-tool for using WFC.
